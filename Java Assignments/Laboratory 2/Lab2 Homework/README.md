**Home assignment**

Choose one of the problems below and provide a layered architecture solution (in Java). Requirements necessary for the next lab:
-	The layers should be: domain, repository, service, UI. Use Java packages.
-	For the repository part use interfaces or abstract classes. The repository should be generic.
-	Add at least 5 entities of each type in your memory repository (from source code).
-	All entities should be identifiable (use a generic superclass/interface Identifiable) and unique.
-	Add basic data validation and use the exception mechanism in Java for exceptional situations. Show messages in case of such situations.
-	The UI must allow CRUD operations for at least one of the entities.
